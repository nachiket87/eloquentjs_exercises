# Practice Basic Javascript from the Eloquent Javascript Book

### Sweating the small stuff

Although I've worked with Javascript before, this repo is just to practice the "small stuff". Everyone is occasionally flumoxxed by the idiosyncrasies of JS and this is my attempt at covering the basics properly.

Inspired by the following poem:

### For Want of a Nail

For want of a nail the shoe was lost. <br>
For want of a shoe the horse was lost. <br>
For want of a horse the rider was lost. <br>
For want of a rider the message was lost. <br>
For want of a message the battle was lost. <br>
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. <br>
And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. <br>
